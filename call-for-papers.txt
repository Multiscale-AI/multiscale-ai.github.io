    <h1>Call for papers</h1>
    <p>
      Submissions will open in early January 2025,
      join <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/multiscale-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the mailing list</a> to stay updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for contributions that will bring us closer to the building an AI that
      can advance from low-level theory and computationally-expensive simulation code to modeling
      complex systems on a useful time scale. All submissions will be evaluated based
      on their <em>relevance</em> to this goal.

      We are looking for contributions that will bring us closer to the building an AI that
      can advance from low-level theory and computationally-expensive simulation code to modeling
      complex systems on a useful time scale. All submissions will be evaluated based
      on their <em>relevance</em> to this goal.
    </p>
    <h3>New scientific result</h3>
    <p>
      A normal paper that presents a new scientific result. Such papers are evaluated on a balance of
      <em>novelty</em>, <em>significance</em>, and <em>technical quality</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>Dataset or benchmark</h3>
    <p>
      A work that presents a new dataset or benchmark – a way to measure progress in the field. The dataset must be open and available to the community; source code must be released under an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OSI-approved license</a>. In terms of evaluation, <em>technical quality</em> and <em>significance</em> are the
      most important criteria.
    </p>
    <h3>Findings and open challenges</h3>
    <p>This is the track for <em>significance</em> and <em>novelty</em>. Submissions can have no code and experiments at all, but the authors still carry the burden to convince the reviewers that their ideas are worth exploring. We are looking for submissions introducing and discussing overlooked scientific questions and potential future directions for a given application area. We encourage submission that address open challenges and describe: 1. Why the current research and state-of-the-art fall short for a given challenges; 2. What directions the authors believe the community can focus on to help address the open challenge. Track idea by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ai4mat/submissions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AI4AM</a></p>
    <h3>Engineering (TBC)</h3>
    <p>
      Working with complex systems requires good software engineering. In this track we are looking for
      contributions that will help the community to build better software. Contributions can be
      <em>tools</em>, <em>libraries</em>, <em>frameworks</em>, or <em>infrastructure</em>. The most important criteria are
      <em>technical quality</em> and <em>significance</em>. The code must be released under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OSI-approved license</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Policy [Draft]</h2>
    <p>Please note that this is a draft of the policy. It will be finalized by the time submissions open.</p>
    <p>Publication of code and data is encouraged, but not mandatory for the "new scientific result" track. Reviewers are allowed to consider open source as a positive contribution to the study significance.</p>
    <p>Provision for review of code and data is encouraged, but not mandatory. Reviewers are allowed to consider provision of code and data as a positive contribution to technical quality.</p>
    <p>
      We welcome ongoing and unpublished work. We will reject work previously published in archiving venues.
      The definition of archiving venue follows the ICLR policy, e.g. arXiv is considered non-archiving, despite its name. We will however accept papers that are under review at any venue at the time of submission.
    </p>
    <p>Double blind reviewing. Submissions will be double blind: reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, and authors cannot see reviewer names. Authors are responsible for anonymizing their submissions.</p>
    <p>Submissions and reviews will not be public. Only accepted papers will be published on the workshop website, but still considered non-archival.</p>
    <p>Format: All submissions must be in PDF format using the ICLR 2025 style file (but change the header to make clear that this is a workshop, non main track paper); and all other formatting guidelines, except for the lower page limit.</p>

<h1>Invited Speakers</h1>
<h3>Kostya Novoselov (confirmed)</h3>
<p>Nobel Prize in Physics 2010, <em>inter alia</em>. Director of the Institute of Functional Intelligent Materials at the National University of Singapore, where he leads the <em>multiscale</em> endeavor to develop a new class of smart materials that actively respond to external stimulus – and can't be simulated with the existing methods.</p>
<h3>Daniel Polani (confirmed)</h3>
<p>Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Computer Science, Director of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Research (CAIRR) and Head of the Adaptive Systems Research Group at the University of Hertfordshire. His research interests concentrate on the understanding and modeling of collective complex systems and intelligent decision-making, especially in the context of cognition in artificial and biological agents. His research ranges from fundamental questions, such as the role of embodiment, intrinsic motivations, taskless utilities, self-organization and Artificial Life, to questions from cognitive science, psychology, social science, and biology.</p>
<h3>Sergei Gukov (confirmed)</h3>
<p>Director of Merkin Center for Pure and Applied Mathematics; Consulting Director of American Institute of Mathematics; John D. MacArthur Professor of Theoretical Physics and Mathematics at California Institute of Technology. Sergei is a member of the Scientific Board of the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and a member of the International Advisory Board of the Centre for Quantum Mathematics (QM). He has served on numerous other scientific committees and advisory boards. He is editor of the journal Communications in Mathematical Physics, Journal of Knot Theory and Its Ramifications, and Letters in Mathematical Physics. Known for Gukov–Vafa–Witten superpotential, Gukov–Witten surface operators, and Gukov–Pei–Putrov–Vafa (GPPV) invariants. Sergei's expertise is uniquely positioned at the intersection of theoretical physics, mathematics and machine learning.</p>
<h3>Charlotte Bunne (confirmed)</h3>
<p>Assistant professor at EPFL in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) and School of Life Sciences (SV) and a member of the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC). Before, she was a PostDoc at Genentech and Stanford with Aviv Regev and Jure Leskovec and in 2023 completed a PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich working with Andreas Krause and Marco Cuturi. During her graduate studies, she was a visiting researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard hosted by Anne Carpenter and Shantanu Singh and worked with Stefanie Jegelka at MIT. Her research aims to advance personalized medicine by utilizing machine learning and large-scale biomedical data. Charlotte Bunne’s interdisciplinary research has won several (best paper) awards. Charlotte has been a Fellow of the German National Academic Foundation and is a recipient of the ETH Medal.</p>
<h3>Qianxiao Li (confirmed)</h3>
<p>Assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore. He graduated with a BA in mathematics from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in applied mathematics from Princeton University in 2016. His research interests include the interplay of machine learning and dynamical systems, control theory, stochastic optimization algorithms and data-driven methods for science and engineering. He is a recipient of the PSTA Young Scientist Award, National Research Foundation Singapore. Qianxiao has published in top material science and machine learning venues, such as Journal of Machine Learning Research, International Conference on Machine Learning, and Matter.</p>
